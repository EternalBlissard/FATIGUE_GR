FATIGUE-GR is a multimodal dataset designed for fatigue-aware gesture recognition in extended human-computer interaction. The data was collected from 41 participants using Delsys Avanti EMG and IMU sensors while interacting in a virtual reality (VR) environment. Participants played five VR games, each controlled by a distinct hand gesture: air tap, swipe, pinch, fist, and grab. Each game lasted up to 20 minutes, and participants reported their subjective fatigue every 20 seconds using the Borg CR scale (0â€“10).

The data collection was conducted in two sessions, with:
1. A 10-minute break between consecutive gestures, and
2. A minimum 2-hour gap between the two sessions to reduce carryover fatigue.

This setup allows researchers to analyze fatigue progression and gesture recognition over time in realistic VR interactions.# FATIGUE_GR
